## 🚀 About This Repository

Welcome to my digital lab! This repository serves as a central hub for my hardware experiments, personal knowledge management (PKM) workflows, and continuous learning paths. It's a living project that documents my journey in tinkering with technology and organizing knowledge.

The core philosophy combines hands-on hardware hacking (exploring devices like ZTE and TP-Link routers) with a structured "Second Brain" using the P.A.R.A. method across Notion and Obsidian.

## 🛠️ Modules

### 🔬 Hardware Lab
This is where I document my experiments with consumer hardware, focusing on unlocking, modding, and understanding their inner workings.

- **ZTE H196A Unlock:** Notes, scripts, and procedures for unlocking the ZTE H196A router.
- **TP-Link WR841N Hacking:** Exploring custom firmware (OpenWrt/DD-WRT) and hardware modifications for the classic WR841N.

### 🧠 PKM System (P.A.R.A.)
My approach to building a "Second Brain" for capturing, organizing, and connecting information.

- **Notion Dashboard:** Templates and guides for setting up a high-level P.A.R.A. dashboard for project and life management.
- **Obsidian Vault:** A starter template for a networked thought vault, designed for deep knowledge development and daily notes.

### 📚 Learning Paths
A curated collection of roadmaps, notes, and resources for my professional development.

- **DevOps Roadmap:** Tracking my progress through the DevOps landscape, from CI/CD and IaC to observability.
- **Coding Challenges:** Solutions and notes for various coding problems and algorithm practice.
